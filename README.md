## Get Started With Your Own Project

### A new project

Click the above "Open in Gitpod" button to start a new workspace. Once you're ready to push your first code changes, Gitpod will guide you to fork this project so you own it.

### An existing project

To get started with Laravel with MySQL on Gitpod, add a [`.gitpod.yml`](./.gitpod.yml) file which contains the configuration to improve the developer experience on Gitpod. To learn more, please see the [Getting Started](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started) documentation.

## Notes & caveats


- This Laravel installation is with [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/installation#choosing-your-sail-services).
  - It is the most powerful, but the first boot takes a couple of minutes.
  - This is because service images have to be pulled from Docker Hub and the base Sail container has to built.
- If you're looking for a light alternative, consider using [Gitpod Sample for Laravel and SQLite](https://github.com/gitpod-samples/template-php-laravel-sqlite)
